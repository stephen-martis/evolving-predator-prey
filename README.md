# Evolving predator prey
Simulation code for predator-prey system with evolutionary dynamics, associated with the manuscript:

Stephen Martis. "Eco-evolutionary feedback can stabilize diverse predator-prey communities"

Code is contained in two folders "deterministic" and "stochastic."  Within each folder are relevant run files (e.g. *.sh) and relevant main code bases (e.g. *.py).

# Dependencies
Code was run and tested using Python >=3.7.

Dependencies include the packages numpy, pqdict, and pickle.  Code was run and tested on the most recent versions of these packages.

# Running the code
Code can be run using the included runfiles, though these can be customized to utilize any reasonable input.  Single simulation runs can take significant time and memory so it is suggested to use a computing cluster to generate figures similar to those in the main text.
